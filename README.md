# [Traffic Sign Classification Using Custom Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/Brandon-Cruz/Traffic)
*	Performed data cleaning and normalization, including reshaping images into arrays and applying one-hot encoding, to enhance the model’s efficiency in processing the data 
*	Applied data augmentation to help with skewness and split into the train, and validation, the test set was provided 
*	Developed the initial architecture of the CNN model and employed GridSearch for hyper tunning, maximizing the model’s performance 
*	Generated plots to visualize the validation metrics, including Accuracy/F1 and loss, providing a visual assessment of the model’s performance 
*	Concluded with a Test Accuracy of 86% and an F1 score of 8
